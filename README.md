First Frontend Mentor challenge. I built it as a first step to use this training platform. The project is very simple â€” just a card with a QR code. It was built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The main container of the card is a compound component that allows adding, removing, or changing the order of its elements very easily. I put the texts in a separate file called data, which in the real world would be replaced by an API call. I hope to have time to keep working on more challenges.
